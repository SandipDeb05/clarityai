      <p>
        ClarityAI (“we,” “our,” or “the Extension”) is a Chrome browser
        extension that provides AI-powered answers to user queries. In addition
        to analyzing the content of the active browser tab, the Extension also
        supports general questions and includes a Meaning Explorer feature for
        understanding the meaning of words, phrases, and sentences. This Privacy
        Policy explains what data is accessed, how it is used, and how we
        protect your privacy.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Scope & Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        The Extension has a single purpose: to allow users to ask questions and
        receive AI-generated responses. These responses may be informed by the
        content of the active web page (when the user explicitly requests it),
        or they may address general questions independent of browsing activity.
        In addition, the Extension includes a Meaning Explorer feature, enabling
        users to explore the meaning of words, phrases, and sentences. The
        Extension's functionality depends on temporarily accessing the active
        tab content only when you initiate an action.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Data We Access and Process</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Active tab content:</strong> When you explicitly trigger the
          Extension for context-based responses, we may read visible text from
          the active browser tab to provide more relevant answers. This access
          is temporary and occurs only when you initiate the action.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>User queries:</strong> The questions you type—including
          general inquiries and Meaning Explorer requests (e.g., definitions of
          words, phrases, or sentences)—are transmitted as part of the request
          to generate a response.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Technical metadata:</strong> Minimal metadata (such as request
          timestamps) may be processed for performance monitoring and debugging.
          This metadata does not include personal identifiers unless you
          explicitly provide them in your query or within the page content.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. How Data Is Processed</h2>
      <p>
        When you initiate a request, the Extension may send the active tab
        content (if you explicitly request a context-based answer) and your
        query—including general questions or Meaning Explorer inputs—to our
        server endpoint hosted on Cloudflare Workers. The Cloudflare Worker
        securely forwards the request to the Google Gemini API (or another AI
        model) to generate a text response. The AI-generated response is then
        returned to the Extension and displayed to you directly in the browser.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Data Storage & Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We do not permanently store personal data or the content of your active
        tabs. All requests are processed in real time; any temporary data held
        in transit is discarded immediately after the response is generated. We
        do not build user profiles, sell data, or share your browsing data with
        third parties for advertising purposes.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        The Extension uses the Google Gemini API via a Cloudflare Worker to
        generate AI responses. This service processes the request and returns
        generated content. You can review Google's data and privacy practices
        here:
        <a
          href="https://policies.google.com/privacy"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          >Google Privacy Policy</a
        >.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Permissions Justification</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>activeTab:</strong> Required to access the content of the
          current tab only when you explicitly ask the Extension to process that
          page.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Host permissions:</strong> Requested to enable script
          execution on pages where the Extension is active; usage is limited to
          user-initiated actions and the minimum scopes required.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Remote Code</h2>
      <p>
        The Extension does not execute remote JavaScript at runtime. All
        executable code is packaged within the extension. External network
        requests are limited to API calls that return structured data (JSON or
        text) processed by our code—no external scripts are downloaded and
        executed in the browser.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Security</h2>
      <p>
        All network communications between the extension, our Cloudflare Worker,
        and third-party services use HTTPS/TLS. We follow industry-standard
        practices to protect data in transit and implement reasonable safeguards
        to minimize risk. However, no system can be completely secure; do not
        include sensitive personal information in your queries or on web pages
        you ask the Extension to analyze.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Your Choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You control when the Extension reads a page: access is only performed
          on explicit user action.
        </li>
        <li>
          To prevent access, disable or remove the Extension via Chrome's
          extensions page (<code>chrome://extensions/</code>).
        </li>
        <li>
          If you prefer not to use remote AI services, do not initiate queries
          that send content to our server.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>10. Children</h2>
      <p>
        The Extension is not intended for use by children under the age of 13.
        We do not knowingly collect information from children; if you believe we
        have inadvertently collected data from a child, contact us to request
        deletion.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. The “Last updated” date
        at the top will reflect any changes. Continued use of the Extension
        after changes indicates acceptance of the revised policy.
      </p>
